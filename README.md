# CS330-Project
Class project involving OpenGL



    How do I approach designing software?
    
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

          It has helped me to gain skills in working with OpenGL and creating things in a 3D world.
         
        What design process did you follow for your project work?

          My design process started with finding a reference image and figuring out what shapes I would need for my scene. After I had my shapes completed I worked on placement, textures and lighting in that order.
        
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

          These tatics could be applied in future work by getting an idea of what needs to be done and work on it in steps to complete the work.
          
    How do I approach developing programs?
    
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

          New development strategies I learned were how to created object shapes, how to apply textures, how to apply material reference for lighting, and how to apply lighting.
        
        How did iteration factor into your development?

          The iteration of shapes was used in my development as many of the same shapes were needed.
        
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

          It evolved once I had a better understanding of how things worked with OpenGL.
        
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
         
          It gives me new knowledge about how graphics and visualizations work in the computer world. There are a lot of calculations that need to be made to make things work correctly and that is something new I learned.
         
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

          It gives me knowledge and skills for my future professional pathway by providing me with an understanding of how graphics and visualizations work and how to create them.
